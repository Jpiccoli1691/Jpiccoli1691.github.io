  <h1>Welcome to my Page!</h1>
  <p> This is my Website.<br> It is red and black all over soon it will be better then it is as this is my first website and I am learning word for word bit by bit on how to create it. It will be great it is just going to have to take some time. <br> please check back with me every so often.<br> There is not much in the way of style yet as I am still learning how to HTML so bear with me as I learn more as time passes </p>
