        <p id="Piccoli_bio">Hello, I am Jonathan. I have a limited background in CSC and HTML. All I had when I was little was a Green and black screen computer consule and all you could do with it was code on. That is what I did all day was type line by line code out on that green and black screen that would destroy your eyesight within minutes. The best thing I ever created with code was a house that had smoke coming from the chimney when I was 4 years old that was 34 years ago. After many attempts at trying other things out in life I have decided to go back trying my luck with CSC and learn to code again maybe I will pick up enough of it like I did when I was little so that one day I could take over the world one day with it.

              <p id="Interests">I am currently assisting my brother with his small start up GareGamesInc. He is the BrainChild of it all currently. We both have a strong background for loving the video games and how they are created. Unfournlty I have let my coding skills go to the way side all these years. I am hoping to soon correct that and help with the coding of his future games.  </p>
