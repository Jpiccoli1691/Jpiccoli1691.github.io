          Hello, I am Jonathan. I have a limited background in CSC and HTML. 
          All I had when I was little was a Green and black screen computer consule and all you could do with it was code on.
            That is what I did all day was type line by line code out on that green and black screen that would destroy your eyesight within minutes. 
            The best thing I ever created with code was a house that had smoke coming from the chimney when I was 4 years old that was 34 years ago. 
            After many attempts at trying other things out in life I have decided to go back trying my luck with CSC and learn to code again maybe I will pick up enough of it like I did when I was little so that one day I could take over the world one day with it. 
        </p>

          When I was in the Service I trained to be a Surface Rescue Swimmer. 
          Like the CoastGuards Swimmer, but for the ships. I have a love of the water, but it doesnt love me back.
           I love to swim and I swim often, but not as much as i did when I was younger.

          My main interest right now is to learn coding so that I can assist my brother with his small start up GareGamesInc some day soon.
          He is the Lead Developer of it all currently. 
          We both have a strong background for loving the video games and how they are created. 
          Unfortunately, I have let my coding skills go to the way side all these years. 
          I am hoping to soon correct that and help with the coding of his future games.
